if I change a model, delete migrations and run makemigrations and then migrate
migrate a class with  ./manage.py makemigrations

If Git is still tracking files that are listed in your .gitignore, it’s likely because these files were already added to the repository before the .gitignore rules were applied. Git only stops tracking files after they are removed from the repository's index (the staging area), even if they’re now listed in .gitignore.
FIX -> 
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
gid commit -m "<commit message>"
git push
