TODO:
    newscraper:

        Make newscraper a function with a main

    webpage:
        eventually I have to settle in between class based views and function based views

        need to correct all the file names

        Need to add different kinds of quizes such a slidebar   

        When the user is done give him the results for the entire quiz and how he did compared to the other users
        Check when logging in the homepage if the quiz is alreaday completed. In that case instead of play button it should show "see results/see results"

        quiz folder should be renamed to challenge

        1)create user model where there will be stored all his results

        also  each daily challenge will have in the model stored all the stats associated with it which will be updated every lets say
        10 users have filled the quiz

        check what's going on when I already have all the cookies and no answer is loading

        find a way to check the answered that has been chosen

    process
